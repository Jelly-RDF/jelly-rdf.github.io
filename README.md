# Jelly website and documentation repository

See the deployed website here: **https://jelly-rdf.github.io**

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. You can also [**open an issue**](https://github.com/Jelly-RDF/jelly-rdf.github.io/issues/new/choose) to discuss documentation changes or improvements.

If you want to instead contribute to the Jelly serialization format or the Jelly-JVM implementation, see these repositories and their issue trackers:

- [Jelly serialization format and streaming protocol](https://github.com/Jelly-RDF/jelly-protobuf) ([issue tracker](https://github.com/Jelly-RDF/jelly-protobuf/issues))
- [Jelly-JVM](https://github.com/Jelly-RDF/jelly-jvm) ([issue tracker](https://github.com/Jelly-RDF/jelly-jvm/issues))

## Editing the documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown and built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). The source files are in the `docs` directory â€“ feel free to edit them directly.

**More information on how to edit the documentation can be found in the [contribution guide](https://jelly-rdf.github.io/dev/contributing/) on the website.**

### Local testing of the website

Install the project's dependencies from `requirements.txt` (preferably in a virtual environment). Then, run `mkdocs serve` to compile the docs and serve them locally for testing.
