# Jelly

**Jelly** is a high-performance binary serialization format and streaming protocol for [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) knowledge graphs. Jelly has a JVM implementation that works with [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/), [RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/), and [Titanium](https://github.com/filip26/titanium-rdf-api).

## How fast is it?

*Fast.* Jelly was specifically designed to serialize and deserialize streams of RDF data faster than N-Triples or other binary formats, while being [more compact than Turtle](performance/index.md#grouped-streaming-serialized-size).

The benchmarks below were performed on streams of RDF graphs or datasets, but Jelly is also good at handling streams of triples or quads ("classic" serialization). The benchmark was performed with Jelly-JVM 2.7.0 with Apache Jena 5.3.0. See: **[more benchmark results and details about the benchmark setup](performance/index.md)**.
