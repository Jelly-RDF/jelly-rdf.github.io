# File extensions and media types

We recommend using these file extensions and media types when working with Jelly:

| | File extension | Media type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Jelly RDF serialization](serialization.md) | `.jelly` | `application/x-jelly-rdf` |

The files should be saved in the [delimited variant of Jelly](serialization.md#delimited-variant-of-jelly).
