# File extension and media type

Jelly is not tied to any specific file extension and does not have a registered media type. However, you can use the following:

- File extension: `.jelly`
- Media type: `application/x-jelly-rdf`

The files should be saved in the [delimited variant of Jelly](serialization.md#delimited-variant).
