Implementations MAY choose to implement only a subset of the following specification. In this case, they SHOULD clearly specify which parts of the specification they implement. In the rest of this specification, the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", etc. refer to full (not partial) implementations.

!!! note

    Implementations may in particular choose to not implement features that are not supported on the target platform (e.g., RDF datasets, RDF-star, generalized RDF terms, etc.).
